# REQUIREMENTS
## Introduction
### The marksheet generator is a system which allows the digital automation of the mark-sheets of the students. The project aims at developing a marksheet generation system which can be used in universities to automate the distribution of digitally verifiable student result mark sheets. The system accesses the student's results information from the institute student database and generates the mark shteets. Aim is to generate marksheets system C Programming Language
## Research
### [Research Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287718426_PDF_Marksheet_Generator)
## Features
### -Entering rollno
### -entering name
### -class
### -marks
## Defining our system
### Our system used to generate the marksheet for the students and have the set of operations for the students to entering rollno, name, class, marks
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### 1 Strength
#### - Manual entry of scores/ grades of students
#### -Auto-calculate final and course grades
#### 2 Weakness
#### - Unavailability of hardware
#### - Lack of user friendly interface
#### 3 Oppurtunities
#### - Innovations
#### - Providing easy access for students
#### 4 Threats
#### - Privacy issues
#### - Doing Fraud
## 4W's and 1'H
### Who
#### Students can access the site                                             
### What
#### Overall grade of the students
### When 
#### When students need their marksheet they can access
### Where 
#### At present the project execution lunch locally on system
### How 
#### Based on the research, identifying the features and implementing the requirements in the C programming language and test them to deliverying the product
